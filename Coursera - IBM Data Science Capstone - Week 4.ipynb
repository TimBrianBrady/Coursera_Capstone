Anyone that's visited the town of Warner Robins quickly realizes that there are an abundance of restaurants in the town. \n\nI have a friend that has gotten the entrepreneurial spirit and wants to start a business. He is set on starting a restaurant and has asked for my help to figure out what kind and where to put it. He doesn't care what type of restaurant, but he wants it to be successful (and near his home in the city.)\n\nI have decided to help him by using Foursquare data to map out the current restaurants in Warner Robins and identify restaurant types that are well established in other parts of town, but under-represented in his part of town. From there, I will further identify potential locations near his home. \n\nWhen complete, I hope to be able to offer him a location and type of restaurant suggestion based on current data, which he can then take and start doing more research on his own.",

From there, I will do k-means clustering and find the optimal K to get an understanding of how the area is actually segmented by restaurants, then within one cluster, I want to find a style of restaurant that is highly represented in other clusters, but not in the selected.\n\n<i>More specific version:</i>\n\n<b>Step 1:</b> Get an understanding of how Warner Robins is currently segmented for all restaurants by performing k-means clustering, and searching for the optimal k.\n    To do this, I will use Foursquare Venue Categories that contain \"Restaurant\" as part of the category name for the data to perform k-means clustering.\n\n<b>Step 2:</b> Given optimal-k clusters, I want to rank the top 5-10 types of restaurants within each cluster.\n\n<b>Step 3:</b> I will then choose a cluster. I'll assume my client lives in a given cluster and would want to start a business there.\n\n<b>Step 4:</b> I want to compare the top 5-10 types of restaurants within each cluster to the chosen cluster and determine dissimilarities.\n    This will provide insight because if a certain restaurant is well represented on the east side of town (for example) and under-represented on the west side of town, there is an opportunity to establish a new restaurant on the west side.\n    \n<b>Step 5:</b> Choose a restaurant type. Ideal type would be highly represented in other clusters, but lowly represented in the chosen cluster.\n\n<b>Step 6:</b> If the clusters are still rather large, do another round of clustering on the chosen cluster to try and identify a more specific area to locate a restaurant. I would want to recommend a location for the restaurant near other, but dissimilar restaurants.\n\n<b>Step 7:</b> Choose a location. At this point we should be able to say I think you should start X restaurant around Y location.",
